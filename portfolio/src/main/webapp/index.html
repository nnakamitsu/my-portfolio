      <h1>Nathan Nakamitsu</h1>
      <p>This is my portfolio.</p>
      <p>Hello! My name is Nathan and I'm from Los Altos Hills, CA.  
          I am a rising sophomore at UC Berkeley studying Computer Science and Data Science.
         I am also a huge sports fan. I love to play all sports 
          (especially baseball and soccer), compete in fantasy sports, and, 
          of course, watch my favorite teams and athletes compete in the MLB, NFL, and NBA.
